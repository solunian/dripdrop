              You should have any sort of container that can be filled with water.
              Most kinds will suffice from plastic to metal, even paper!

            <div>
              Then, you can go to the store and buy some water for yourself!

            <div>
              If you have a water filter at home or are apathetic to health hazards,
              use the tap!

              {"Hi, it's Daniel! I'm just going to ramble on for a bit."} This is all just a joke; I just made everything up for fun. The design for this website
              is completely inspired by <PageLink href="https://fresh.deno.dev/">{"Fresh's website"}</PageLink> even
              though I used the <PageLink href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</PageLink> web framework instead lol. I think their developers also
              used <PageLink href="https://tailwindcss.com/">tailwindcss</PageLink> which was interesting, but not that crazy
              because tailwind is epic. Also... I spent an exorbitant amount of time on <PageLink href="https://react-spring.dev/">react spring</PageLink> which
              was pretty frustrating because the `useChain` hook would not work, and all the animations would run
              simultaneously, and it was a huge mess. Oh... I forgot about dealing with the water bottle svg... that was a
              rollercoaster. <PageLink href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</PageLink> is pretty nice when it comes to deploy projects like this. Very cool!
              Some maxims that have held up over this project: some K-pop songs are crazy fire, sleep is important,
              do not be coding late into the night, procrastination is bad, web development is hard.
              But at least, I finished this in less than 12 hours of work. Yay. {"ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥"}
